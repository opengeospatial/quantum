# Quantum Discussion Paper

This repository contains content and imagery for a discussion paper focused on the applications of quantum computing to geospatial problems.

The use cases reported on in this repository is a combination of work completed as part of customer contracts and internally funded research.

The paper covers an introduction to quantum computing, and in particular, adiabatic quantum computing which used for solving optimization problems.

Use cases and practical examples of quantum computing are described in the domains of logistics, knowledge graphs, data sampling, and satellite contellation opmtimization. 

The potential for standardization and the implications for OGC API - Processes is described at the end of a document with a proposal for changes to the standard. Many of the requirements for supporting quantum will be satisfied by the Deploy, Redeploy, Undeploy extension which is forthcoming.

## OGC Templates

This GitHub repository contains templates for OGC documents. These templates are built to work in the Metanorma publishing environment. You can write your documents just with a copy of the appropriate template and do not need to install Metanorma or use the Docker container unless you want to compile the documents to their final publication style.

Note that the Apache license applies only to the template. Once a  document has been created, the license must reflect the OGC document license.
