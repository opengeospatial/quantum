# OGC Templates

This GitHub repository contains templates for OGC documents. These templates are built to work in the Metanorma publishing environment. You can write your documents just with a copy of the appropriate template and do not need to install Metanorma or use the Docker container unless you want to compile the documents to their final publication style.

Note that the Apache license applies only to the template. Once a  document has been created, the license must reflect the OGC document license.
